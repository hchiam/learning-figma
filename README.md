# Learning [Figma](https://www.figma.com)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Following tutorial: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3FV65ZrUs> (But you might want to look at the short [official Figma intro tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2dkpBxst8&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4&index=1).)

Example Figma interative demo page: <https://www.figma.com/proto/dWPMZc0LYEkG7VB9uqUV6S/Figma-Tutorial?node-id=2%3A2&scaling=scale-down>

Learn Bravo to make native apps from Figma prototypes: <https://github.com/hchiam/learning-bravo-studio>

"Figma for VS Code" extension so devs can collaborate from VSCode in real time, and get code suggestions based on Figma designs: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension - NOTE: **in beta as of 2023**

Dev mode Figma to translate design to code faster (**in beta as of 2023**):
  - NON-dev mode (design mode) example: https://www.figma.com/file/UNYqpMVdlSlnjuBO20WRfr/Mobile-Wireframe-UI-Kit-(Community)?type=design&node-id=37-92&mode=design&t=rwE92hE52j9xtQIm-0
  - dev mode example: https://www.figma.com/file/UNYqpMVdlSlnjuBO20WRfr/Mobile-Wireframe-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=40%3A191&mode=dev (you need to be logged into Figma) with things like:
  - hover to inspect some things kinda like [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) or [VisBug](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug)
  - click to copy generated code (CSS/HTML/JSX/Tailwind/etc.!) to clipboard
  - click to download icon SVGs

## A quick summary of other design tools:

From [Meng To](https://twitter.com/MengTo/status/1109203931580645377):

```text
My thoughts on design tools and why you should pick them.

Figma: collaboration and all-in-one
Sketch: maturity and plugins
Framer: code and advanced prototyping
Studio: free and animation
XD: speed and adobe platform
```

Or if you have more time, read a more involved analysis on [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/sketch-figma-adobe-xd-ui-design-applications).

For creating images like SVGs, I'd use [Photopea](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-photopea)
