My thoughts on design tools and why you should pick them.

Figma: collaboration and all-in-one
Sketch: maturity and plugins
Framer: code and advanced prototyping
Studio: free and animation
XD: speed and adobe platform
```

Or if you have more time, read a more involved analysis on [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/sketch-figma-adobe-xd-ui-design-applications).

For creating images like SVGs, I'd use [Photopea](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-photopea)
